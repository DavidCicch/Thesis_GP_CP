Minimized code from the work on my thesis. \
The main changed files are: fullgp.py and gputil_new.py. \
Newly created files are: GP_CP_Class-py, Poisson_Process.py and the kernel files in CP_Kernel. 

An example notebook is in the folder 'notebooks'. Here there is an example of the marginal GP, latent GP and a marginal GP with two kernels.
